import Dispatch


/// A `FutureResult` is container that will be asynchronously filled with a 
/// `Result`. A `FutureResult` can be returned by an asynchronous function that 
/// can fail. The function later fills the `FutureResult` with a `Result` 
/// indicating the success or failure of the function. 
/// 
/// A `FutureResult` is only filled _once._ Handlers attached to the future 
/// before the value is filled are dispatched when the handler is filled. 
/// Handlers attached after the future has been filled are dispatched 
/// immediately. 
/// 
/// This base implementation does nothing â€” it exists to define the core API 
/// that subclasses must implement. It is written as a class instead of a 
/// protocol to keep it easy to use and extend. (It was initially written as a 
/// protocol, but it required deep knowledge of Swift's protocol capabilities 
/// to use, maintain, and extend.) 
/// 
/// Subclasses must be thread-safe.
