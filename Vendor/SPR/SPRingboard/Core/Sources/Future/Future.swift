import Dispatch


/// A `Future` is container that will be asynchronously filled with a value. An 
/// asynchronous function can synchronously return a future, then fill the 
/// future later when its asynchronous operations complete.

/// A future is only filled _once._ Handlers attached to the future before the
/// value is filled are executed at the time the handler is filled. Handlers 
/// attached after the future has been filled are executed immediately. 
/// 
/// This base implementation does nothing â€” it exists to define the core API 
/// that subclasses must implement. It is written as a class instead of a 
/// protocol to keep it easy to use and extend. (It was initially written as a 
/// protocol, but it required deep knowledge of Swift's protocol capabilities 
/// to use, maintain, and extend.)

/// Subclasses must be thread-safe.
